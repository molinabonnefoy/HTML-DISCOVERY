Checking Text Length
====================

In the previous exercise, we were able to use `min` and `max` to set acceptable minimum and maximum values in a number field. But what about text fields? There are certainly cases where we wouldn't want our users typing more than a certain number of characters (think about the character cap for messages on Twitter). We might even want to set a minimum number of characters. Conveniently, there are built-in HTML5 validations for these situations.

To set a minimum number of characters for a text field, we add the `minlength` attribute and a value to set a minimum value. Similarly, to set the maximum number of characters for a text field, we use the `maxlength` attribute and set a maximum value. Let's take a look at these attributes in code:
````html
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="summary">Summarize your feelings in less than 250 characters</label>
  <input id="summary" name="summary" type="text" minlength="5" maxlength="250" required>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

````

If a user tries to submit the `<form>` with less than the set minimum, this message appears:

![prompt on a number field for user to length the input](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-forms/minlength.png)

And if a user tries to type in more than the maximum allowed number of characters, they don't get a warning message, but they can't type it in!

Let's add this validation to our `<form>`.

Instructions

1. For the login `<form>`, we want our users to have usernames that are at least 3 characters and at most 15. Let's add this validation to our current `<form>`.
To the `<input>` with an `id` of `"username"`, add the following attributes and values:
    -   a `minlength` of `"3"`.
    -   a `maxlength` of `"15"`.
2. We also want passwords to have at least 8 characters and at most 15. So, in the opening <input> tag that has an id of "pw", add a minlength of "8" and a maxlength of "15".
