Table Data
==========

Rows aren't sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined. In HTML, you can add data using the *table data* element: `<td>`.
````html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>
````

In the example above, two data points (`73` and `81`) were entered in the one row that exists. By adding two data points, we created two cells of data.

If the table were displayed in the browser, it would show a table with one row and two columns.

# Instructions

1. In the second row, add three cells of data. The cells should contain the following data, in order:
-   Adam's Greenworks
-   14
-   Package Items
