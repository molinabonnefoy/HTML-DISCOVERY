Table Body
==========

Over time, a table can grow to contain a lot of data and become very long. When this happens, the table can be sectioned off so that it is easier to manage.

Long tables can be sectioned off using the *table body* element: `<tbody>`.

The `<tbody>` element should contain all of the table's data, excluding the table headings (more on this in a later exercise).

````html
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Saturday</th>
      <th>Sunday</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Morning</th>
      <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
      <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th>Afternoon</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Evening</th>
      <td>Dinner</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

````

In the example above, all of the table data is contained within a table body element. Note, however, that the headings were also kept in the table's body --- we'll change this in the next exercise.

# Instructions

1. Enclose rows 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the table in a `<tbody>` element.
