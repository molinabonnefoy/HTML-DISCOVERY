Styling with CSS
================

Tables, by default, are very bland. They have no borders, the font color is black, and the typeface is the same type used for other HTML elements.

You can use CSS to style tables. Specifically, you can style the various aspects mentioned above.
````html
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
````

The code in the example above demonstrates just some of the various table aspects you can style using CSS properties.

# Instructions

1. In style.css, change the font size of all table headings and table data to 18 pixels.
