Table Head
==========

In the last exercise, the table's headings were kept inside of the table's body. When a table's body is sectioned off, however, it also makes sense to section off the table's column headings using the `<thead>` element.
````html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
      <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Morning</th>
      <td rowspan="2">Work</td>
      <td rowspan="3">Relax</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <th scope="row">Afternoon</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Evening</th>
      <td>Dinner</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
````

In the example above, the only new element is `<thead>`. The table headings are contained inside of this element. Note that the table's head still requires a row in order to contain the table headings.

Additionally, only the column headings go under the `<thead>` element. We can use the `scope` attribute on `<th>` elements to indicate whether a `<th>` element is being used as a `"row"` heading or a `"col"` heading.

# Instructions

1. Enclose the first row of the table in a `<thead>` element.
