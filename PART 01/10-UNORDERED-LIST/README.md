Introduction to HTML
====================

So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose "Inspect," and you'll see HTML in a panel of your screen.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

-   A *markup* language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
-   In HTML, the computer can interpret *raw text* that is wrapped in HTML elements.
-   *HyperText* is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as *hyperlinks*. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.

Learning HTML is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of knowledge can help you inject code snippets into newsletter, blog or website templates. As you continue learning, you can layer HTML with CSS and JavaScript to create visually compelling and dynamic websites. But for now, we're going to focus on how to add and modify basic content on a page, like text, images, and videos. Don't worry if the websites look ugly --- we're just getting started.
