The Head
========

So far you've done two things to set up the file properly:

-   Declared to the browser that your code is HTML with `<!DOCTYPE html>`
-   Added the HTML element (`<html>`) that will contain the rest of your code.

We have added these elements to the Brown Bears page you previously created. Now, let's also give the browser some information about the page itself. We can do this by adding a `<head>` element.

Remember the `<body>` tag? The `<head>` element is part of this HTML metaphor. It goes above our `<body>` element.

The `<head>` element contains the *metadata* for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. Unlike the information inside of the `<body>` tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself. You'll see an example of this in the next exercise.

The opening and closing head tags typically appear as the first item after your first HTML tag:
````html
<head>
</head>
````
# Instructions

1. Place the `<head>` element below the opening `<html>` tag.
