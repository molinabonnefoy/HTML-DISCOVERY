Main and Footer
===============

Two more structural elements are `<main>` and `<footer>`. These elements along with `<nav>` and `<header>` help describe where an element is located based on conventional web development standards.

The element `<main>` is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag is separate from the `<footer>` and the `<nav>` of a web page since these elements don't contain the principal content. By using `<main>` as opposed to a `<div>` element, screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content.

So how does `<main>` look when incorporated into our code? That's a great question.
````html
<main>
  <header>
    <h1>Types of Sports</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h3>Baseball</h3>
    <p>
      The first game of baseball was played in Cooperstown, New York in the summer of 1839.
    </p>
  </article>
</main>

````

As we see above, `<main>` contains an `<article>` and `<header>` tag with child elements that hold the most important information related to the page.

The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the *footer*, indicated by the `<footer>` element. The footer contains information such as:

-   Contact information
-   Copyright information
-   Terms of use
-   Site Map
-   Reference to top of page links

For example:
````html
<footer>
  <p>Email me at Codey@Codecademy.com</p>
</footer>
````
In the example above, the footer is used to contain contact information. The `<footer>` tag is separate from the `<main>` element and typically located at the bottom of the content.

# Instructions

1. In the code editor, find the `<div id="main">` tag and change it to `<main>`.

2. Now, find the `<div id="footer">` tag and change it to `<footer>`.
